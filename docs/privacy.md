# Privacy and Data Protection

## Design Philosophy

The MAI-T1D Synthetic Data Generator is designed under a privacy-by-design framework. Its primary goal is to enable broad methodological development and pipeline validation while eliminating exposure of individual-level participant data from the TEDDY study.

The pipeline does not attempt to anonymize real data. Instead, it generates entirely new synthetic records that approximate population-level statistical properties without preserving individual trajectories.

## Participant Identifier Protection

All original participant identifiers are replaced with synthetic identifiers generated from a reserved numeric range. The mapping between original and synthetic identifiers is maintained only within the execution environment and is not recoverable from synthetic outputs alone.

Synthetic identifiers are consistently applied across all modalities to preserve cross-modal structure without revealing original identities.

## Genomic Privacy Considerations

Genomic data present unique privacy risks due to their high dimensionality and potential identifiability. The pipeline mitigates these risks through several design choices:

- Synthetic genotypes are generated from learned distributions rather than perturbed real genomes
- No real participant genotype is preserved or modified
- Linkage disequilibrium structure is approximated statistically rather than copied
- Variant metadata are preserved, but genotype realizations are entirely synthetic

The resulting data are suitable for methodological exploration but do not correspond to any real individual.

## FASTQ Data Handling

FASTQ files are not synthesized at the read level. Raw sequencing reads remain unchanged, and only filenames are rewritten using synthetic identifiers.

This design choice avoids:
- Accidental leakage of real genomic sequence content through flawed synthesis
- Misrepresentation of synthetic reads as biologically meaningful data
- Increased risk of re-identification through rare variant patterns

FASTQ renaming is intended solely for workflow integration testing.

## Differential Privacy

The current pipeline does not provide formal differential privacy guarantees. However, the modeling framework is compatible with emerging differentially private generative methods.

Recent research has explored differentially private copula-based and GAN-based synthesis approaches. These methods remain an active area of investigation, particularly for high-dimensional genomic data, and may be incorporated in future versions following careful evaluation.

## Risk Assessment

Synthetic data generated by this pipeline significantly reduce re-identification risk compared to real data. However, as with all synthetic data, residual risk may remain depending on the adversary model and downstream usage.

Users are encouraged to:
- Treat synthetic data as non-identifiable but not equivalent to public data
- Avoid attempting linkage attacks
- Follow institutional data governance guidelines when distributing synthetic outputs

---

## Regulatory Alignment

The MAI-T1D Synthetic Data Generator is designed to support:
- NIH data sharing and reuse goals
- GDPR and HIPAA principles of data minimization and privacy protection
- Institutional review board expectations for non-identifiable data generation

Synthetic outputs are intended to lower barriers to collaboration while respecting participant consent and regulatory obligations.

## Summary

By combining principled statistical modeling, strict schema enforcement, and conservative handling of raw genomic artifacts, the MAI-T1D Synthetic Data Generator provides a robust and privacy-aware foundation for synthetic biomedical data generation.
